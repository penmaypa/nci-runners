<h1> Getting Started</h1>

<h2> Start a Running Plan </h2>

<p>
  Your running plan will depend on how fit you are. But according to <a href="https://www.fitnessmagazine.com/workout/running/running-101-a-beginners-guide/">FitnessMagazin.com</a> You can start by running for 20 minutes at a time, three times per week. Gradually increase the amount of time you're running and the number of days you run, but do not increase either until you feel comfortable completing your current level of training. If 20 minutes is too much, don't be afraid to take walking breaks. Perhaps begin by running for 4 minutes and walking for 1 minute, until you complete the 20 minutes. As you get stronger, begin eliminating the walk breaks.

<p>
  Your training also depends on how fit you are. In my case, I would run for as long as I can run and once I'm out of breath, I take a recovery walk.
  <br>
   A recovery walk should take 2 to 3 min. Then I would start running for 4 min. If not able to run for 4 mins then take recovery walk and then try 3 mins.

  Remember to train 3 to 4 times a week. Recovery days are very important for your muscle to heal and lessen injuries. Warm Up and Warm down are also important which we will talk about later on.

  Your Training plan should look something like these
